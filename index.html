        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p class="left-description">My coding adventures began around 2019, when I was first looking into
          the subject. Later, once I realized there was room for me to grow
          here, I knew I had to keep learning more. Fast forward to today and I
          now have a coding arsenal that consists of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

        <h3>Art & Creative Design</h3>
        <p class="right-description">I've been making art ever since I can remember. As a small child I dumped
          my large tub of crayons all over the floor and arranged them in-line with
          the color spectrum. As a young teenager I took private art lessons from
          an art teacher, and won county fair awards, including one for first place
          in the high school level. I learned various art techniques, styles, and
          mediums including digital art when I began to show some interest in graphic
          design. To this day I continue creating and designing things for fun or
          that I want to see brought into reality.

        <h3>Plant Care</h3>
        <p class="left-description">I've always had an affinity towards living things, as well as the structure
          and source of life itself. Being the curious creature that I am I like
          to examine, learn about and care for all kinds of life. Plants in
          particular are one of the more accessible and easier to accumulate without
          making yourself look like a nutcase.
